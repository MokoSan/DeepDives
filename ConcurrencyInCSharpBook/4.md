# Chapter 13: Scheduling

1. A scheduler is an object that decides __where__ a piece of code runs.
2. For a majority of the cases (barring ASP.NET), schedule work using ``Task.Run(..)`` on the background thread.
   1. ``Task.Run`` vs. ``TaskFactory.StartNew``
      1. ``Task.Run(() => ..)`` is a shortcut to do: ``Task.Factory.StartNew(someAction,CancellationToken.None, TaskCreationOptions.DenyChildAttach, TaskScheduler.Default)``.
      2. ``Task.Run`` doesn't support parent/child tasks.
3. For a majority of the cases use, ``TaskScheduler.Default`` - this schedules work on the Thread Pool. 
4. You can grab a copy of the current scheduler from ``TaskScheduler.FromCurrentSynchronizationContext()``.
5. ``ConcurrentExclusiveSchedulerPair`` consists of 2 schedulers related to each other.
   1. 2 Schedulers:
      1. __The Concurrent Scheduler__ member is a scheduler that allows multiple tasks to execute at the same time, as long as no task is executing on the ExclusiveScheduler.
      2. __The Exclusive Scheduler__ only executes code one task at a time, and only when thereâ€™s no task already executing on the ConcurrentScheduler.
   2. This scheduler can be used as a throttling scheduler.
      1. Applies throttling around an existing scheduler e.g. ``TaskScheduler.Default``.
6. Make use of ``ParallelOptions`` to control parallelism that needs scheduling.
7. Synchronization by TaskScheduler only applies while the code is executing.
