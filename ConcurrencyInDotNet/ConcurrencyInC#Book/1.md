# Chapter 1: Concurrency An Overview

1. __Concurrency__: Doing more than one thing at a time.
2. __Multithreading__: A form of concurrency that uses multiple threads of execution.
3. __Parallel Processing__: Doing lots of work divided up among multiple threads that run concurrently.
   1. Parallel Processing uses multithreading to maximize the use of multiple cores.
4. __Asynchronous Programming__: A form of concurrency that uses futures or callbacks to avoid unnecessary threads.
   1. Asynchronous operations don't block.
5. __Reactive Programming__: Application reacts to events in a declarative way.
6. Modern Design is more functional friendly.
