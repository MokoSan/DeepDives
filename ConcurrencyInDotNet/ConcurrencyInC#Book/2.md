# Chapter 9: Collections

1. __Immutable Collections__: 
   1. Immutable collections should be used when the underlying collection doesn't change too often.
   2. Characteristics
      1. An instance of an immutable collection never changes.
      2. Since it never changes, it is naturally threadsafe.
      3. When you call a modifying method on an immutable collection, the new modified collection is returned.
   3. Even though immutable collections are threadsafe, references to immutable collections are not threadsafe. A variable that refers to an immutable collection needs the same synchronization protections as any other variable.
   4. Good for sharing state but bad for communication conduits.
      1. Don't use immutable collections for cross thread communication.
2. __Immutable Lists__ use binary tree as its underlying structure to maximize memory utilization.
   1. Use a foreach vs. a for to enumerate as O(N) - foreach vs. O(NlogN) - for
      1. O(logN) for indexing - binary tree.
3. __Immutable Dictionary__ can be used to store reference data i.e. static data.
4. __Concurrent Dictionary__
   1. ``AddOrUpdate`` in rare cases _might_ have invoke either / both delegates (One for Add, other for Update) multiple times.
      1. Delegates should be simple and only create the value.
   2. ``ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue>`` is best when you have multiple threads reading and writing to a shared collection. 
      1. If the updates are not constant (if theyâ€™re more rare), then ImmutableDictionary<TKey, TValue> may be a better choice.
5. __Blocking Collections__
   1. Used as conduits to pass messages between threads.
   2. Great when there are dedicated threads for producers and consumers.
6. __Asynchronous Queues__
   1. Conduit for message passing without blocking threads.
   2. Use ``Channels``.
7. __Throttling Queues__
   1. You have a producer/consumer queue, and your producers might run faster than your consumers, which would cause undesired memory usage. You also want to keep all the queue items, so you need a way to throttle the producers.
