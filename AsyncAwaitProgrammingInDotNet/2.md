# [Asynchronous programming with async and await](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/)

1. Async vs. Parallel
   1. Parallel: Doing things at the same time. 
   2. Async: Doing things in a non blocking way.
2. The composition of an asynchronous operation followed by synchronous work is an asynchronous operation. Stated another way, if any portion of an operation is asynchronous, the entire operation is asynchronous. 
   1. You compose tasks by separating the operations into a new method that returns a task. You can choose to await that task or start more tasks concurrently.
3. The language features for ``async`` and ``await`` provide the translation every person makes to follow those written instructions: start tasks as you can and don't block waiting for tasks to complete.
