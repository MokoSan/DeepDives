# Asynchronous programming

1. For I/O Bound code, await the I/O bound async method.
2. For CPU Bound code, await the long running task in a ``Task.Run(...)`` call.
3. ``await`` suspends the calling method and yields control back to its caller until the awaited task is complete. 
4. Core of async programming is the ``Task`` and ``Task<T>`` type.
5. By including ``async`` in the method signature, the compiler automatically sets up a state machine.
   1. If ``await`` isn't used, the method will never yield control and will block.
6. By convention, append ``Async`` to any method that will be run asynchronously.
7. Since LINQ uses lazy or deferred execution, using async-await lazily can be troublesome as that code could run when you wouldn't expect it.
